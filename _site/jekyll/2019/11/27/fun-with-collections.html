<h1>Fun with collections</h1>

<p class="view">by Julia Hack</p>

<p>I noticed the “collections” requirement on the assignment and I was not sure what to do. I assumed that creating a collection, and displaying it on a page, would fit this requirement.</p>

<p>I decided to create a colleciton about travel, as I enjoy traveling and never really write about my trips. I don’t have much time today to really flesh these out and write a lot of detail, but perhaps I can do this in the future. It might actually be fun to create my own travel blog at some point. It would also help me work on my web dev skills. Maybe I can try another jekyll blog? Or wordpress? Honestly, though, jekyll seems more appealing to work with as you seem to have more control.</p>

<p>Anyway, writing about travel was fun, now let’s move on. I believe now I need to install a plugin. Perhaps now is a good time for another back-up, in case I struggle with the pluggin. I think a plugin relating to forms would be a good choice here.</p>
