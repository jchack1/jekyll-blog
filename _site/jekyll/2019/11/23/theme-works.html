<h1>The theme is working!</h1>

<p class="view">by Julia Hack</p>

<p>Update - I got the theme to work! In our assignment guidelines we were told to choose from one of the github pages themes. I found that I didn’t particularly like most of the themes, especially as a design person. They were just not my style. I chose the “minimal” theme and I decided I would just try to customize it more to my liking.</p>

<p>I struggled in class this week to get a theme to work. I suppose that is just because I didn’t know what I was doing yet. I must have been missing some critical yet small piece to the puzzle. Today I tried this strategy and had success:</p>

<p>-set up my site folder with a few pages, posts, layouts, navigation, and data
-download the theme folder from github onto my machine
-copied files one by one into my site folder, being careful about which ones I wanted to replace
-made sure the gem file and config file were from the minimal theme
-used command “bundle install”
-then command “bundle exec jekyll serve”
-realized that I needed the minimal layouts in my site folder, made a few changes to my pages
-now I am seeing my pages, with the minimal theme. Yay!</p>
