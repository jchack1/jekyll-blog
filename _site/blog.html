            <p><p>There were some things that could be improved in the styling, so I went into the Sass file and added some code.</p>

            <p><p>I noticed the “collections” requirement on the assignment and I was not sure what to do. I assumed that creating a collection, and displaying it on a page, would fit this requirement.</p>

            <p><p>The past couple days I was trying to get pagination to work. I believe in the last post I said a classmate mentioned that there was a paginate version 2.</p>

            <p><p>One thing I need to attempt today is pagination. I tried it a few days ago, but it did not work. When I tried googling for solutions, I found that pagination only works on the index page.</p>

            <p><p>Because I had the problem of things getting deleted, and things deciding not to work (there must be a logical reason for this, I hope…), I am making a back-up of all my files. Currently they are all working I would like to not repeat all of these steps later…</p>

            <p><p>First of all, I would like to give credit to the Jekyll documentation step-by-step tutorial for giving me the code to work with on my blog page.</p>

            <h2><a href="/jekyll/2019/11/23/theme-works.html">The theme is working!</a></h2>
            <p><p>Update - I got the theme to work! In our assignment guidelines we were told to choose from one of the github pages themes. I found that I didn’t particularly like most of the themes, especially as a design person. They were just not my style. I chose the “minimal” theme and I decided I would just try to customize it more to my liking.</p>

        <li>
            <h2><a href="/jekyll/2019/11/23/blog-working.html">Blog is working</a></h2>
            <p><p>I just saved my post, and used the command “bundle exec jekyll serve” to start serving my site to localhost:4000. It appears that my posts are showing up on this page and working as expected. Once I have more posts created I will consider creating categories.</p>
</p>

        <li>
            <h2><a href="/jekyll/2019/11/23/first-post.html">First Post</a></h2>
            <p><p>This is my first post on my Jekyll website. On this site I am creating a blog with enough posts to require pagination. I am plannning to create posts about my experience with Jekyll, thoughts on web development, and stories about my photos and art that you can see on this site. Now that I have a post and most of my pages created, I am going to try installing a theme. I struggled with this when I first started, and I suspect that I am missing a small yet crucial piece, so today I am going to try again and see what happens. Wish me luck.</p>
