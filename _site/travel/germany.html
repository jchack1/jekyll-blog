<h1>Germany</h1>

<p class="view">by Julia Hack</p>

<p>I visited Germany on my trip to Europe in 2016.  First we went to Berlin. If you like World War II and Cold War history this is a great city to visit. You can see the remnants of the Berlin Wall, and even follow placks down some streets were the wall used to stand. The Holocaust memorial is a very interesting monument, and can be unsettling to walk through, but it was one of the highlights of Berlin for me.</p>

<p>Later on in our trip we went to the Rhine river area. This was a sleepier part of Germany and I think most tourism was geared towards people older than myself, but I enjoyed having a more relaxed time. We stayed in the very charming town of Bacharach. It looks like a town from a fairy tale and has an almost magical feeling.</p>
