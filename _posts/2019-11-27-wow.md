My contact form is now working!

I can't believe how easy this was. I just googled "jekyll form plugins" and the first recommended option on jekyllthemes.io was Formspree. I quickly signed up, put the link into the action of my form, verified my email, and done! Now I can receive messages from people. 

The form does not look very nice, so now I will look into the CSS and see if there are any changes I can make to the contact page, and hopefully the navigation as well - it looks a little boring at the moment.
