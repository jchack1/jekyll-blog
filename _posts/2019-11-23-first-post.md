This is my first post on my Jekyll website. On this site I am creating a blog with enough posts to require pagination. I am plannning to create posts about my experience with Jekyll, thoughts on web development, and stories about my photos and art that you can see on this site. Now that I have a post and most of my pages created, I am going to try installing a theme. I struggled with this when I first started, and I suspect that I am missing a small yet crucial piece, so today I am going to try again and see what happens. Wish me luck.
