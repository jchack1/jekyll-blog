The past couple days I was trying to get pagination to work. I believe in the last post I said a classmate mentioned that there was a paginate version 2. 

I gave this a try, because I really did not want to move all of my blog posts onto the index page in order to get pagination to work. I am not sure what I did wrong, but I kept getting errors. I read a few articles on pagination, but they all had different instructions. I tried to piece them together, added code to my config file, my gem file, and possibly other files.  I found out, however, that pagination is no longer a requirement, so I may leave this for another project.
