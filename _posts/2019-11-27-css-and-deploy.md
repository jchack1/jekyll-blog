There were some things that could be improved in the styling, so I went into the Sass file and added some code. 

I wanted to make the menu look better, so I used display: flex.  I adjusted this for different sizes so it looks much better now. I also fixed the contact form so it looks more appealing, and made a few adjustments to spacing of the content.

I think I have reached a state of completion and now it is time to deploy. My plan is to upload to github and use netlify. I hopefully will not have any problems, but we will see. Overall I enjoyed using jekyll. Since it is mostly code based I find it's easier to work with than wordpress. I find it strange that I have come to this conclusion, because by all accounts wordpress is supposed to be easy to use, but perhaps I just had a difficult experience with it the first time around. It also seems that jekyll has some bugs, or maybe some features I am not fully understanding yet. I will make another jekyll blog in the future for more practice, as I said in a previous post.
