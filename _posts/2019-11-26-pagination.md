One thing I need to attempt today is pagination. I tried it a few days ago, but it did not work. When I tried googling for solutions, I found that pagination only works on the index page.

This is different from what I have heard from a classmate, who said if you are using version 2 it should not be an issue. I am going to look into this and see what happens.
