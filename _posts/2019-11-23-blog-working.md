I just saved my post, and used the command "bundle exec jekyll serve" to start serving my site to localhost:4000. It appears that my posts are showing up on this page and working as expected. Once I have more posts created I will consider creating categories. 

As of right now I think I would like to "live blog" my experience creating this site, if you will. I cannot find the instructions for what the content of the posts should be, but I think as long as it is my own content it should be fine. If I have other content relating to art, photography, or other things,I can make categories for those things, and set it up so I have pages that display the posts from these categories only.
