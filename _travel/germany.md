I visited Germany on my trip to Europe in 2016.  First we went to Berlin. If you like World War II and Cold War history this is a great city to visit. You can see the remnants of the Berlin Wall, and even follow placks down some streets were the wall used to stand. The Holocaust memorial is a very interesting monument, and can be unsettling to walk through, but it was one of the highlights of Berlin for me.

Later on in our trip we went to the Rhine river area. This was a sleepier part of Germany and I think most tourism was geared towards people older than myself, but I enjoyed having a more relaxed time. We stayed in the very charming town of Bacharach. It looks like a town from a fairy tale and has an almost magical feeling.
